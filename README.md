Another boilerplate project, but this one has Swag and Emojis 👾 made by https://igital.co.

*	Webpack
*	Swag Sass Framework
*	Compiled ES6 Javascript

## Configuration
Before you install and run the webpack compiler, edit the config */app/config/settings.json* and insert your values there,
you can use settings variables from the json file in the templates.

## Install and start swaggin'
```
git clone https://github.com/ro0t/Boilertal.git
cd Boilertal
yarn

## Stylesheets
Edit the config files in */app/style/config/* to fit your needs.
Place your component stylings in */app/style/components/* and load them at the bottom of */app/style/swag.scss*.

## Javascript Code
All of your javascript should be in */app/src/*, and you can import it from the bootstrap file */app/bootstrap.js*.
